# Ohana

Ohana is a headless private social network api that can connect via a public user interface (WIP) or a private user interface. It can support multiple "families" which have "members" connected through "family members". It's been intentionally designed to allow for self-hosting and distributed use cases.

##### The Backstory
Ohana came about after seeing multiple family members uncomftable using traditional public social media networks because they didn't want to share information but also didn't want to send an email because they didn't want to bother anyone. Ohana aims to be a middle ground that allows the connectiveness that social networks leverage while being distriubted and privatized to remove the productization of users. IIRC's distributed nature and Monica (Open Sourced Personal CRM) at MonicaHQ were both major influences to the system design of this project.

###### Notice
Ohana is in open beta under Version 1; Ohana will rename on offical release under "Ohana Open Source Software" a.k.a. "Ohana" or "Ohana OSS" under [this](https://github.com/OhanaOSS) Github Organization to provide seperation from my personal Github profile. This replace will occur upon the offical beta release of the public user interface. Contribute with a name for Ohana to be renamed to or the name for the public interface projects (browser and mobile), [Open an issue!] The Public Interfaces will be developed with React and React Native.

# Inital Features!

You can also:

### Tech

Ohana uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby on Rails 5] - A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications!
* [Devise_token_auth] - awesome web token and authentication gem as a branch off devise.
* [Pundit] - an awesome policy management gem to manage authorization.
* [Active Model Serializer] - a serializer for Ruby on Rails
* [Docker] - a containerization in production
* [PostgreSQL] - an awesome database

And of course Ohana itself is open source with a [public repository][Ohana]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Ohana requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) v2.5+ to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Ohana
$ bundle install
$ rails server
```

For production environments with docker from your applicaiton server with the edge docker repo. Also, you will need to ensure that you have setup a new PostgresSQL Database. You can view the docker [repo here](https://hub.docker.com/r/lassitergregg/Ohana/).

Now you will want to run:
```sh
$ docker pull lassitergregg/Ohana
$ docker run -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_BASE -e PRODUCTION_DB_NAME=YOUR_DATA_BASE_NAME -e PRODUCTION_DB_LOGIN=YOUR_DB_ADMIN_LOGIN -e PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD -e PRODUCTION_DB_HOST=YOUR_DB_HOST -p 3000:3000 -d Ohana
```
If you're running a raw server without a webserver to direct traffic, we suggest [nginx]!

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Ohana uses RSpec for testing and here is how to get started. Build out following the [roadmap] docs or open an issue and make a suggestion!

Clone the repo and create a branch to work in:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lassiter/Ohana.git
$ git checkout -b [issue_number]-[description]
```

Once you're done, open a pull request to `api-master`.

If you want to be an even bigger help, we need help building out the documentation and reducing the barrier of entry to non-technical people.

#### Docs
You can view the docs here: [OhanaOSS/hale docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1274680/RW1hhFn9)

### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Write MORE documentation
 - Write the Roadmap (what do you want to see?) [Open an issue!]
 - Setup a build with Heroku button
 - Setup CI for Testing
